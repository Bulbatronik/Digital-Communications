# Digital Communication 2 Project

Welcome to the Digital Communications 2 project repository offered at Politecnico di Milano! This project aims to design a Predistortion and Adaptation System using MATLAB/Simulink to compensate for the distortion caused by non-linearity in an amplifier. By employing a pre-distorter before the amplifier, we can mitigate its non-linearity and achieve signal linearization within a specified region. The adaptation process ensures the proper adjustment of pre-distorter gain to achieve optimal performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need MATLAB and Simulink installed on your system. Simply clone this repository to your local machine:


## Starting ##

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/Bulbatronik/Digital-Communications.git

# Access
$ cd digital-communications
```
## Usage

1. Navigate to the `simulink` folder.
2. Open the `project_simulink.slx` file in MATLAB/SIMULINK.
3. Explore the simulation model and parameters.
4. Run the simulation to observe the predistortion and adaptation system in action.
